## 2024-12-12 - Day Five

Goal for today is to get a single AoC puzzle done and to test out the `std::println` feature and get that working with `clang` and `clangd`.

### Notes

- Adding in a `.clangd` file with a simple instruction to use c++23 made the entire thing _just work_. Well, after I added the flag to the respective `build.bat` file.
- Todays puzzle is also a tricky one, but one that could probably root in a ton of recursion maybe. Let's see!
- Initially, I kinda wanted to generate a mask for each possible combination, but soon realized that this wouldn't make sense, as it would be 2^n combinations.
- So I went with a recursive method, just traversing and testing for all combinations and discarding the ones that doesn't work.
- I discovered that `atoi` is 32bit, while `_atoi64` is 64bit, which I needed in this task. That's funny.
- I ended up just adding a third operator for part 2 and it was super easy with `std::format()` from `C++23`. Great day. I like puzzles that need recursion.
