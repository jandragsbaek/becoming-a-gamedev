## 2024-12-11 - Day Three

So goal for today is to do day 5 of AoC and that's it. I got myself a glove80, that I want to mess around with tonight. I want to start learning the new layout that I've decided to use with it. That one will be .. different and exciting.

### Notes

- So at first read, 2024-05 seemed rather difficult, but I came up with just parsing the list and making a list of rules and simply just loop through every rule and break the looping, if it violates said rule. It would just take a little while to get it implemented.
- I made a nice discovery with making a `std::map` with `std::vector` as the second part, which _just worked_. Syntax looks a little funky, and I can imagine this can nest pretty deep, as it probably is templating behind the scenes. `std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>`. It's not _that bad_.
- After I tried doing the above, I ended up making a `struct` to contain two `std::vector`s instead. Nice little practical introduction to that.
- Part 2 of the 2024-05 had me doing manipulations to the array, until the rules were correct. A straightforward task, that involved copying two items in a `std::vector`. There's probably a clever way to do it, but I just did the simple method with a `tmp` variable on the side. `a = 1; b = 2; tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;`.
